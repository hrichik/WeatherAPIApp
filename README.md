# WeatherAPIApp
A C#/.NET Application I made that uses APIs to retrieve weather data on cities inputted by the user.

- C# & .NET 8: Built a console-based application using modern C# async/await patterns.
- Asynchronous Programming: Utilized async/await and Task.WhenAll for concurrent operations.
- API Integration:
  - Fetched geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for cities using the OpenCage Geocoding API.
  - Retrieved real-time weather data (temperature and wind direction) using the Open-Meteo API.
- HTTP Requests: Implemented HTTP GET requests using HttpClient.
- JSON Parsing: Processed JSON responses using System.Text.Json to extract relevant data.
- Error Handling: Used try-catch blocks to gracefully handle API errors or invalid inputs.
- User Interaction: Interactive console input loop allowing users to repeatedly query different cities.
- Programming Fundamentals: Showcased string manipulation, loops, conditional logic, method abstraction, and exception handling.
- Clean & Modular Code: Structured program into reusable methods for fetching coordinates, fetching weather, and prompting user.
- Hands-On Practical Knowledge: Demonstrates full-stack understanding of integrating APIs, asynchronous workflows, and data parsing in C#.
